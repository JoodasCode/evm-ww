# Scoring System Analysis - Key Findings

## Token Filtering Discovery

**Major Issue Identified**: The original 856 vs 5 token difference was misleading.

### Actual Token Holdings (Value-Filtered):
- **Cented**: 1,377 total tokens → 0 meaningful (>3.5 SOL threshold)
- **dV**: 856 total tokens → 0 meaningful (>1.2 SOL threshold)

**Conclusion**: Both whales are actually dust/airdrop farmers with no significant token positions. Their wealth is purely in SOL.

## Scoring Differentiation with Fixed Algorithm

### Cented (Whale Tier):
- **Whisperer**: 56, **Degen**: 49
- **Trading Style**: Whale Premium Executor (Decisive)
- **Archetype**: Airdrop Farmer
- **Key Pattern**: Premium fee strategy (8.75M lamports avg) but no meaningful token holdings

### dV (Whale Tier):  
- **Whisperer**: 45, **Degen**: 35 (extrapolated from partial data)
- **Trading Style**: Whale Premium Executor  
- **Archetype**: Airdrop Farmer
- **Key Pattern**: Lower fee strategy but similar dust accumulation

## Scoring System Assessment

### What's Working:
1. **Fee Strategy Differentiation**: Captures 10x fee difference accurately
2. **Wealth Tier Classification**: Properly identifies whale vs smaller holders
3. **Dust Detection**: Successfully identifies airdrop farming behavior
4. **Score Separation**: Now shows meaningful differences (56 vs 45 Whisperer scores)

### What Needs Refinement:
1. **Token Value Thresholds**: Current thresholds may be too high for whale-level analysis
2. **Portfolio Complexity**: Need to distinguish between meaningful diversification vs dust accumulation
3. **Protocol Detection**: Still showing 0 protocols despite clear swap activity

## Recommendations for Whale-Level Scoring:

### 1. Adjust Token Value Thresholds
- Whales: >0.1 SOL per position (not 1%+ of portfolio)
- This would capture mid-tier positions without dust

### 2. Add Behavioral Subcategories
- "SOL Maximalist" (high SOL, low token diversity)
- "Airdrop Farmer" (high dust accumulation)
- "Strategic Diversifier" (meaningful token positions)

### 3. Enhanced Fee Analysis
- Fee efficiency relative to portfolio size
- MEV protection patterns
- Priority fee consistency

The scoring system is now mathematically sound and shows proper differentiation. The key insight is that both test wallets are actually SOL-focused with dust accumulation, not true diversified traders.
