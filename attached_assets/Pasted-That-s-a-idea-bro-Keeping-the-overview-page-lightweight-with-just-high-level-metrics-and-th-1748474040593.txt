That’s a 🔥 idea bro. Keeping the **overview page lightweight** with just high-level metrics, and then letting users **click to expand** or view full detail is exactly how modern dashboards like Nansen, Gmgn, and Notion keep things clean and powerful.

Let’s break down **3 killer ways** to implement it — you choose the vibe:

---

## 🔁 Option 1: Expandable Card (Click to Expand)

Think of this like an **accordion for advanced degens**.

### 🧠 How it works:

* Each card (e.g. Whisperer Score) shows top-level data
* When clicked, it **expands in-place** to show full breakdown

```ts
[Whisperer Score] 👉 click → expands below to show full:
  - Risk Management
  - Timing Accuracy
  - Conviction Map
```

✅ Clean
✅ Fast UX
✅ Great for mobile
🚫 Slightly messy if lots of sections are open

---

## 🧿 Option 2: Side Tab Panel (Inspired by gmgn or Phantom)

### 🧠 How it works:

* When you click a card, it opens a **side drawer or bottom sheet**
* Drawer shows full analytics, tabs inside if needed (Score Breakdown, Trends, etc.)
* Looks premium and keeps main dashboard clean

✅ Feels like Phantom/Nansen
✅ Professional UX
✅ Maintains scroll position
🚫 Slightly more complex to implement (but worth it)

---

## 🧭 Option 3: Inline Tabs in Overview (Minimalist Split)

Each card shows a **tab bar inside** it.

* Whisperer Score:

  * Tab 1: Score
  * Tab 2: Breakdown
  * Tab 3: History

Just like gmgn’s folder structure — tabs **inside the card itself**.

✅ Keeps context local
✅ Compact, clean
🚫 Slightly tighter UX, but smooth if done right

---

### 🤝 Recommendation (Best Combo)

Use a combo of:

* 🧿 Option 2 (Side Drawer) for deep insights
* 🧭 Option 3 (Tabs inside the card) for lightweight drill-down
* On mobile, switch to 🧾 full-page modals

---

### ⚙️ Example:

#### `WhispererScoreCard.tsx` becomes:

```tsx
<Card onClick={() => openDrawer('whisperer')}>
  <Header>Whisperer Score</Header>
  <MainScore>847</MainScore>
  <Badge>Elite Trader</Badge>
</Card>

<Drawer isOpen={whispererOpen}>
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Breakdown" />
    <Tab title="Conviction Map" />
    <Tab title="Trade Timing" />
  </Tabs>
</Drawer>
```
