Ahh I see what you mean — let’s make these *feel* psychological, even if they use hard data. Less like a dashboard, more like a mirror into the trader’s soul.

Here’s a refined version of **3–4 new psychologically themed cards per tab**, using only **Helius + Moralis + portfolio metadata**, but written with deep behavioral/psychoanalytic framing:

---

### 🧩 **Overview Tab — Psychological Framing**

> “Who you are at a glance.”

* **Behavioral Archetype**
  → Label: *“The Strategist,” “The Gambler,” “The Hoarder,”* based on token count, fee strategy, and protocol diversity.

* **Decision Burnout Meter**
  → Based on trade frequency and variance in timing — high = overtrading, FOMO loops.

* **Confidence Footprint**
  → Avg. token size + hold time + fee level → signals confidence vs hesitation.

* **Risk Posture Radar**
  → Measures aggressiveness based on fee size, swap types, and token concentration.

---

### 🧠 **Behavior Tab — Psychological Framing**

> “Your unconscious routines.”

* **Trading Ritual Clock**
  → Time-of-day clustering → Are you trading at night? In bursts? Emotional windows?

* **Impulse Depth Score**
  → % of tokens sold within 10 min → shows lack of commitment, emotional reactivity.

* **Loyalty Disposition**
  → Protocol or token reuse → are you seeking safety in the familiar or chasing novelty?

* **Micro-Gambling Pattern**
  → High swap count with tiny amounts = addicted to dopamine loops.

---

### 🔎 **Insight Tab — Psychological Framing**

> “How your past shapes your future.”

* **Regret Pattern Analysis**
  → Trades exited *right before* price uptrend = chronic premature exit behavior.

* **Delayed Entry Syndrome**
  → Consistent entry *after* token peaks → fear of missing out overrides logic.

* **Conviction Deficiency**
  → High token count, low average size, short holds = signal of indecisiveness.

* **Hope Syndrome Tracker**
  → Tokens held > 30 days with 70%+ drawdown = refusal to cut losses.

---

### 🧬 **Psychoanalytics Tab — Deep Freudian Vibes**

> “What your trades say about your inner psyche.”

* **Fear Index**
  → Ratio of transfers vs swaps, low exposure = risk aversion, security-seeking.

* **Pain Repetition Cycle**
  → Rebuying tokens that previously dumped on you → repeating traumatic trades.

* **Mood Oscillation Graph**
  → Weekly trade frequency volatility = emotional instability in response to markets.

* **Projection Bias Detector**
  → Trading same token as whales but at different times → imitating without insight.

Want me to generate JSON card templates for one of these tabs to use in the frontend build? Or start visual mockups next?
