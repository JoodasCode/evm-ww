# 🐋 2Whale Test — Cented vs dV

## 📊 Overview

This document compares two real wallets — **Cented Whale** and **dV Whale** — using real data processed through the complete **Helius → Moralis → Supabase pipeline**. The aim is to evaluate how accurate our behavioral scoring engine is and identify potential blind spots.

## 🧠 Wallet Profiles

### 🐋 Cented Whale

* **Portfolio Value:** \$84,192 (350.8 SOL)
* **Token Diversity:** 5 unique tokens
* **Trading Style:** Steady Accumulator *(“Patient” mood)*
* **Whisperer Score:** 75
* **Degen Score:** 93

**Token Breakdown:**

| Token     | Source  | Value   | Notes         |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | ------------- |
| YERBAMATE | Moralis | \~\$22k | Meme/High Vol |
| JOEY      | Moralis | \~\$18k |               |

### 🐋 dV Whale

* **Portfolio Value:** \$28,075 (114.9 SOL)
* **Token Diversity:** 6 named tokens + **856 total tokens** (from Moralis)
* **Trading Style:** Steady Accumulator *(“Patient” mood)*
* **Whisperer Score:** 75 *(same as Cented)*
* **Degen Score:** 93 *(same as Cented)*

**Token Breakdown:**

| Token      | Source  | Value      | Notes                   |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| ClaudeBoys | Moralis | \~\$6.2k   | Meme/Community          |
| TBI        | Moralis | \~\$5.1k   |                         |
| YERBAMATE  | Moralis | \~\$4.7k   | Also present in Cented  |
| Joey       | Moralis | \~\$4.5k   |                         |
| George     | Moralis | \~\$3.6k   |                         |
| Farter     | Moralis | \~\$2.8k   |                         |
| +850 more  | Moralis | \~\$1,000+ | Unnamed micro positions |

**TXNs:** From **Helius**:

* 80+ swaps in the last 30 days
* Lower swap amounts (avg. <\$400)
* Spread across multiple DEXs (unspecified)
* Low transaction fee expenditure

## 🧮 Scoring System Logic (Current Implementation)

**Whisperer Score Inputs:**

* Trade frequency (inverse relationship)
* Profit-taking accuracy
* Win ratio (positive ROI trades vs total)
* Risk appetite (volatility of entries)
* Token hold durations

**Degen Score Inputs:**

* Token category (meme = higher)
* Early entry timestamp
* Rotational behavior
* Gas usage (higher gas = degen)
* Number of unique trades

**Issue:** Despite differences in:

* Token count (5 vs 856)
* Fee behavior (10–16x higher in Cented)
* Volume per trade
* Diversification

...both wallets got **identical scores.**

## 🚨 Identified Problems

### 1. Scoring Overlap Bug

* **Likely cause:** score caching or global state not being reset
* **Fix:** refactor scoring engine to use wallet-specific contexts with isolated state

### 2. Behavioral Blending

* Both profiles are defaulting to “Steady Accumulator”
* We are **not differentiating fee strategy, rotation behavior, or diversification**
* Need: fine-grained thresholds + a tagging engine

### 3. Protocol Detection Failure

* Despite clear swap activity (Helius shows swap instructions), system shows **“0 protocols detected”**
* Likely issue in decoding instruction metadata or missing parser for Jupiter/Orca

### 4. Moralis Data Handling

* We’re not factoring in **token count saturation**
* 856 tokens should be a unique signal: “hoarder,” “rotator,” or “portfolio spray”
* Fix: add logic to evaluate portfolio noise and long-tail concentration

---

## 🧠 Recommendations

1. **Refactor scoring state per wallet**
2. **Create behavior fingerprinting engine**

   * “Premium strategist” vs “wallet sprayer” vs “snipe & dipper”
3. **Weight gas fees and DEX activity in scoring**
4. **Fix Moralis data prioritization**
5. **Add token-count-based behavioral flags**

## 🔭 Next Steps

Would you like to:

* Fix the scoring bug first (state bleed)?
* Rebuild the behavioral detection logic with richer tags?
* Add more whales and run comparisons to further stress-test?

The system is powerful — but we’re missing the edge by blending sharp differences.
Let’s fix that.
