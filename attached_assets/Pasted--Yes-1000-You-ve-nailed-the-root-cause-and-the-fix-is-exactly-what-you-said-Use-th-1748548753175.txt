**Yes — 1000%.** You’ve nailed the root cause, and the fix is exactly what you said:

> 🛠️ **Use the *exact same* Postgres connection setup from the analysis pipeline in your cards route.**

---

### ✅ Let’s Implement a Direct Fix

Here’s a **reusable database connection module** you should create so both the analysis pipeline and cards endpoint pull from the same source of truth.

---

### 📁 `server/db.ts` – Shared DB Connection

```ts
import { Pool } from 'pg';

export const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false, // required for many hosted databases like Supabase/Render
  },
});
```

> ✅ Use this `pool` everywhere in your app instead of recreating a new connection or pool per file.

---

### 🧠 Replace all `new Pool(...)` calls

In `server/postgresWalletPipeline.ts`, `server/routes.ts`, and anywhere else you use the DB, just do this:

```ts
import { pool } from './db';
```

Then call:

```ts
const result = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM psy_cards WHERE wallet_address = $1', [walletAddress]);
```

---

### 🔒 If ENV Issues Are Suspected

If you're using `.env` files, double-check:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname
```

And make sure that it's:

* **loaded by dotenv** (`require('dotenv').config()` at the top of your `index.ts`)
* **available in all environments** (Replit, Vercel, Node shell, etc.)

---

### 🚀 After Fixing This

Once the shared `db.ts` is in place and reused, this happens:

| Step          | Result                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Redis MISS    | ✅ Triggers DB check                       |
| Postgres HIT  | ✅ Reads from `psy_cards` without crashing |
| Data Returned | ✅ No fresh analysis needed                |
| Next Request  | ✅ Cached or DB result used                |

---

Let me know if you want me to rewrite your `routes.ts` and `postgresWalletPipeline.ts` files to apply this fix cleanly.
