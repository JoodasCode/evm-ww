Amazing question — because tagging **token narratives** is *the unlock* for the next wave of psychoanalysis.

Here’s a battle-tested approach that works *now*, using minimal effort but still scalable:

## 🧠 Why Categorize Tokens?

Because it turns raw trades into **behavioral context**:

> "You keep buying AI tokens during hype windows"
> "You exit utility tokens fast but hold memes too long"
> "You used to play Animal memes. Now you're chasing Infra."

Without category tagging, all trades look the same.

## 🛠️ How to Categorize Tokens in V1 (Practical Method)

### ✅ 1. **Manual Seed Tagging (Top 500)**

Start with:

* A simple `token_tags.json` object:

```json
{
  "GEMMY": ["Meme", "Animal"],
  "SAMO": ["Meme", "Dog"],
  "JUP": ["Infra", "DEX"],
  "BONK": ["Meme", "Dog"],
  "CHADGPT": ["Meme", "AI"],
  "PYTH": ["Oracle", "Utility"],
  "MOTHER": ["Meme", "Character"],
  "WEN": ["Meme", "Vapor"]
}
```

You can seed 200–500 tokens manually. 80/20 rule applies — this covers most of what people trade.

### ✅ 2. **Fuzzy Autotagger (Fallback)**

If token not in list:

* Use basic heuristics like:

  * Token name includes `GPT`, `AI`, `FLOKI`, `INU`, `DOGE` → likely Meme/Animal/AI
  * Marketcap < \$10M, LP < \$50k, + verified on pump.fun = Meme
  * `!verified`, recent launch, trending on dexscreener = Meme
  * Tokens bought within 5 mins of listing = Likely Meme (behavior-based tag)

You can flag these as:

```js
tags: ["Unverified", "Likely Meme (Heuristic)"]
```

### ✅ 3. **Community Override (Future)**

Eventually, allow user-tagged overrides:

> “Classify this as AI/Utility/Meme” (stored in Supabase)

## 🧬 How It Powers Psychoanalytics

Once tagged, you unlock:

* **Narrative Loyalty** → “You’re a meme loyalist (81% of trades)”
* **Conviction Bias** → “You size up for Infra, but cut Meme tokens fast”
* **Cycle Drift** → “In March, you chased AI tokens. In May, rotated to Dogs”
* **Performance by Category** → “Memes = -40% avg | Infra = +12% avg”

## 🧠 Categories You Should Support in V1

| Category | Subtype Ideas                          |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Meme     | Animal, AI, Dog, Personality, Pump.fun |
| Utility  | LP token, Governance, NFT infra        |
| Infra    | DEX, Bridge, Oracle, Chain, Layer 2    |
| NFT      | NFT coin, ecosystem token              |
| DeFi     | LPs, yield, stablecoins                |
| Scam     | Honeypot, rug-prone, “danger zone”     |

You don’t need to go crazy — just track **Meme vs Infra vs Utility** at a minimum and layer on as needed.

If you want, I can help:

* Write the `token_tags.json` starter file
* Build the fallback autotagger logic
* Add a `categorizeToken(mint, metadata)` helper function you can use in the pipeline

Let me know. This is how you turn Wallet Whisperer into a **narrative intelligence system**, not just a behavior tracker.
