Absolutely. Here's the **full message** you can send to Replit, now including a note about the system **constantly re-analyzing the same wallet**, which is a red flag.

> 👀 Hey, this is looking much cleaner — thanks for the work so far. But before I trust this pipeline and mark it ✅ production-ready, I need a few things confirmed and fixed:
>
> ---
>
> ### ✅ 1. Redis Behavior Logging
>
> I need **explicit console logs** inside the `/api/cards/:wallet` route showing:
>
> * `[REDIS HIT]` when data is found in cache
> * `[REDIS MISS]` when cache is empty and fallback logic kicks in
>
> This should be logged for every wallet request. Please implement this **now** so I can verify Redis is being used and not skipped.

> ### 🛑 2. Unwanted Re-Analysis Loop
>
> I'm noticing that every single time I call `/api/cards/:wallet`, the console logs show:

> 🚀 Starting automated analysis for CyaE1VxvBrahnPWkqm5VsdCvyS2QmNht2UFrKJHga54o

> ⚠️ This shouldn't happen. If the wallet has already been analyzed and stored in Postgres or cached in Redis, it **should not** re-analyze every time.

> ### ✅ 3. Full Card Type Test
>
> Please send me a complete list of all `cardTypes` now supported. I’ll run a curl test to verify:
>
> * All return valid responses
> * No missing `cardType` blocks
> * No `undefined`, `null`, or placeholder values

> If even one card fails silently or defaults to fallback logic, the system is still brittle.

> Once these are resolved and I confirm via logs + response structure, I’ll sign off.

Let me know if you want me to write the curl + jq test script for all cardTypes too.
