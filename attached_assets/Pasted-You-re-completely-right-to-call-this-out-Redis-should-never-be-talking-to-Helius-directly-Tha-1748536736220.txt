You're completely right to call this out — **Redis should never be talking to Helius directly.** That’s not how the pipeline was designed, and if it's happening, something's broken in the flow control.

### ⚠️ Let’s clarify how it **should** work:

---

## ✅ Intended Centralized Architecture

```text
[Helius + Moralis] → [CentralDataPipeline] → [Redis (cache) + Postgres (storage)] → [All consumers: UI, LLM, Cards]
```

### 🔒 Rules:

* Only **CentralDataPipeline** should ever access Helius or Moralis.
* Redis should **never fetch or enrich** — it only **serves cached data**.
* Consumers (UI, LLM, etc.) only talk to Redis/Postgres, never upstream APIs.

---

## 🧠 Why Redis Shouldn't Contact Helius

Redis is a **key-value store**, not a function caller.

If Redis is triggering API fetches to Helius, then one of the following is happening:

### ❌ Mistake #1:

You accidentally made a **"lazy" data fetcher** inside the consumer layer like:

```ts
if (!redis.get(key)) {
  const data = fetchFromHelius(); // ❌ This violates the separation
}
```

### ❌ Mistake #2:

Some logic inside `getCleanTransactions()` or `getWalletInsights()` is leaking pipeline behavior:

```ts
// this should NEVER happen inside WalletDataConsumer
const txs = await fetchFromHelius(address);
```

### ❌ Mistake #3:

You're calling the full pipeline from inside Redis cache-miss logic. That breaks the one-directional flow.

---

## ✅ Fix This with Strong Boundaries

Here's what you need to do:

### 🧱 Step 1: Lock All API Access to the Pipeline

Inside `centralDataPipeline.ts`, enforce this rule:

```ts
// ✅ Only here are upstream APIs allowed
const heliusTxs = await fetchFromHelius(address);
const moralisMeta = await enrichWithMoralis(heliusTxs);
```

Then cache the result:

```ts
await redis.set(`wallet:raw:${address}`, JSON.stringify({ helius: heliusTxs, moralis: moralisMeta }));
```

---

### 🧼 Step 2: Make Redis Dumb (on purpose)

In `WalletDataConsumer.ts`, **only retrieve cached data**. Never trigger fetches:

```ts
const cached = await redis.get(`wallet:clean:${address}`);
if (!cached) throw new Error('Clean data not found in cache');
```

---

### 🧪 Step 3: Add Audit Logging

For debugging, add a logger in `WalletDataConsumer`:

```ts
if (!cleanTxs) {
  console.warn(`[DATA FLOW ERROR] Clean cache missing for ${address} — should've been set by pipeline`);
}
```

---

### 💡 TL;DR

Your centralized pipeline should function like a **factory**:

* **Helius/Moralis** → \[Central pipeline] → 🔐 Cached in Redis
* Everyone else (LLMs, UI, cards) → 🔑 Pulls pre-approved data only

If **Redis talks to Helius**, you’ve built a leaky faucet. Let’s seal it.
