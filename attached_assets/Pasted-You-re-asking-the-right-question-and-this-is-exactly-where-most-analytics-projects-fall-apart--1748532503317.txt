You're asking the right question ‚Äî and this is **exactly where most analytics projects fall apart**: not in the UI, not in the data ingestion, but in the **assumptions and calculations** that seem logical but are subtly broken.

Let‚Äôs dissect the two possibilities: **bad extraction vs bad math** ‚Äî and how to identify/fix both.

---

## üîç 1. Are We Extracting False Data?

**Extraction** = Getting raw data from Helius, Moralis, GeckoTerminal.

If this is wrong, *everything downstream is tainted*. Here‚Äôs how to debug:

### ‚úÖ Spot Checks for Extraction

| üî¨ What to Check                | ‚úÖ Method                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Are the token balances correct? | Compare against real wallet view (e.g. Solscan, Solflare)            |
| Are swap directions accurate?   | Check `source`, `destination`, `tokenAmount` and `type` on Helius tx |
| Are timestamps accurate?        | Time of tx from blockchain vs our `time_of_day` calculations         |
| Is token metadata real?         | Does BONK have the right name/logo/decimals?                         |
| Are we double-counting txs?     | Manually compare total tx count to Helius explorer                   |
| Is wallet value correct?        | Manually sum token values using latest prices from Gecko             |

üëâ **Sanity Check Tip**: For any wallet we label "whale" or "premium strategist", make sure their behavior matches *what a real whale would do.*

## üìâ 2. Are We Calculating with Flawed Logic?

This is the bigger danger ‚Äî even if the raw data is good, your **formulas, thresholds, or logic could be wrong.**

### üö® High-Risk Calculation Zones

* **Conviction Collapse**
  Are we measuring "holding until loss" or just "delay in selling"?

* **Post-Rug Behavior**
  How are we defining a "rug"? Sharp drop? LP pull? Could be catching false positives.

* **False Conviction**
  Are we identifying bagholding from *intentional DCA*? Those are different.

* **Gas Fee Personality**
  Are lamport values being converted consistently? Or mixing SOL vs lamports?

* **Position Sizing Psychology**
  What defines ‚Äúemotional‚Äù? Variance across trades? Normalized per token type?

---

## üß† Example: Conviction Collapse Might Be Broken

> Cented got 100/100 conviction ‚Äî but his stress was high, and his portfolio had 25 tokens. Shouldn't high diversification + emotional sizing reduce his conviction score?

That tells us:

* We **might not be factoring portfolio churn**
* Or ignoring **position value decay** (are they holding small amounts of 25 things, or big stacks of 2 + noise?)

---

## ‚úÖ What to Do Next: "Math Test Audit"

Let‚Äôs run a **manual trace** on 1 or 2 wallets:

1. Pick a real address (like Cented)
2. Export their raw txs into CSV (already in PostgreSQL or from Helius)
3. Choose 3 cards ‚Äî say:

   * Conviction Collapse
   * Position Sizing Psychology
   * Gas Fee Personality
4. Do the math by hand or script:

   * What is the variance in position sizes?
   * What is the average lamport fee per tx?
   * What is the hold time per token?
5. Compare that **manual score** to what the system says.

If they don't match ‚Äî you‚Äôve found the root of the issue.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools You Might Need

* Add a `debug_mode: true` flag to output **card internals**
* Create a `/diagnostics/:wallet` route that logs:

  * Total txs
  * Avg fee
  * Position sizes
  * Token hold time
* Build a test harness that can replay raw wallet data into each card module

---

## TL;DR

You're not paranoid. If it *feels* off, it probably is.

**Next Steps I Recommend:**

1. Pick 3 wallets (Cented, dV, one anon)
2. Pick 3‚Äì5 cards to manually trace
3. Run raw data ‚Üí card logic ‚Üí result ‚Äî and verify
4. Fix any flawed thresholds or logic
5. Only **then** scale system-wide scoring

Want me to help you build the test harness or audit one of the cards manually?
