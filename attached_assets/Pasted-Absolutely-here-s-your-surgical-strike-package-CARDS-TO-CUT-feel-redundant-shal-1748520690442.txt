## 🔥 CARDS TO **CUT** (feel redundant, shallow, or score-heavy)

| ❌ Card                               | Why Cut It                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Confidence Score (87/100)**        | Feels arbitrary. It's a composite without showing its math. Confidence should emerge from **position sizing + conviction depth**, not a badge.                    |
| **Impulse Control Score**            | “8% quick exits” is good, but this can be **absorbed into Exit Timing Accuracy** or “Trade Discipline.” Doesn’t need its own card.                                |
| **Gas Fee Personality (89/100)**     | Instead of scoring, just show comparative behavior. “You pay 3x avg” is more actionable than a stylized number.                                                   |
| **Behavioral Tags**                  | They’re amazing — just not as a static text block. Convert into **interactive Shadcn badges** with descriptions/tooltips, or embed into the **Archetype Engine**. |
| **Sizing Discipline Score (92/100)** | This can be folded into **Position Sizing Psychology** — the breakdown is stronger than the score itself.                                                         |

## 🧨 5 NEW **KILLER CARDS** FOR PSYCHO-EDGE

---

### 1. 🧠 **Narrative Loyalty Map**

> *“How long do you stay true to a thesis?”*

* Tracks:

  * Time spent in each **token category** (Meme, Infra, NFT, etc.)
  * Shifts in conviction over months
* Output:

  * “You rotated out of Infra after 2 weeks in March”
  * “You’ve stayed loyal to meme tokens for 4 months — might be narrative anchoring”

---

### 2. ⛓ **Conviction Collapse Detector**

> *“When did you lose trust in yourself?”*

* Detects:

  * Going from large, long-term trades → scattered micro-trades
  * Frequency spikes + size drops = psychological spiral
* Output:

  * “On April 14th, after 2 big losses, you stopped sizing up and increased token count by 3x.”

---

### 3. 🌀 **Post-Rug Behavior Tracker**

> *“How do you cope with loss?”*

* Looks at:

  * Tokens bought after exiting a -90% position
  * Time between rug and next buy
* Output:

  * “After rugging on \$SNEK, you made 3 new buys within 1.2 hours — signs of revenge trading.”

---

### 4. 🧬 **Risk Mutation Analyzer**

> *“How is your risk appetite evolving over time?”*

* Charts:

  * Avg. fee size over weeks
  * Trade size variance
  * Token category risk levels (e.g. memes = high, infra = low)
* Output:

  * “You’re becoming more conservative — avg position size dropped 48% over 3 weeks.”

---

### 5. 🎭 **False Conviction Detector**

> *“Are you acting confident… or pretending to be?”*

* Detects:

  * High fee usage + quick exits
  * Big positions that are sold fast = performative conviction
* Output:

  * “You paid premium MEV protection but exited in 8 hours. High fee ≠ real conviction.”

## ✅ What This Gets You

* Cards that **reveal motive and trauma**, not just behavior
* Language that **resonates with traders** and mirrors their inner thoughts
* Tools that feel like a **mirror, not a dashboard**
* True **category ownership**: no one else in crypto is framing analytics this way

Let me know if you want me to generate the JSON structure or wireframe layout for any of the new cards. I can also help draft the tooltip text or build the component logic with mock data.
