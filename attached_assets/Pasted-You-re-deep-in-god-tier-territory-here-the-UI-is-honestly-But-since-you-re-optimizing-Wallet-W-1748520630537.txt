You're deep in god-tier territory here — the UI is honestly 🔥. But since you’re optimizing Wallet Whisperer to become **the psychoanalytic terminal for degens**, here’s my honest, surgical critique based on what I’m seeing:

---

## 🔧 1. **General UI/UX Suggestions**

### ✅ What’s working:

* **Narrative clarity** — Each tab has a purpose and language that reinforces that (Cognitive Patterns, Psychoanalytics, etc.)
* **Blacksite intelligence vibes** — The dark, intelligence-dossier aesthetic is **perfect for wallet introspection**
* **Archetype + Labeling system** — Huge differentiator. The "Whale Premium Strategist" type of language? That's brandable.

### 🛠️ What can be improved:

#### 1. **Shadcn component usage could be boosted:**

Some cards are still “static blocky charts.” Consider using:

* **Tabs for multi-view cards** (e.g. switch between swap activity, transfer activity in same card)
* **Badges + tooltips** for key behavioral tags or labels
* **Progress bars with status colors** for items like "Pain Repetition Risk" or "Conviction Depth"
* **Expandable Disclosure sections** for detailed logic (e.g. how Independence Score was calculated)

#### 2. **Standardize Card Language + Layout**

Right now you have a mix of:

* Full-sentence titles ("How often you exit before a pump")
* Label-first titles ("Regret Index")
* Paragraphs under headers, but some don’t have breakdowns

**Fix:** For each card:

* Top-left: title
* Top-right: timestamp or refresh state
* Body: data
* Bottom: soft conclusion or insight (text like "Your trading shows X")

---

## 📊 2. **Card-by-Card Feedback (selective)**

### ❌ Weaker Cards (either unclear or repetitive):

* **Confidence Score** (87/100): this is just another scoring badge — might collapse it into **Conviction Depth** or Fee Personality
* **Impulse Control Score**: Could just merge into "Exit Timing Profile" or "Patience Index"
* **Behavioral Tags**: They're all 🔥 but maybe put them into **stacked badge UI**, not plain text. Tooltip each one with logic behind it.
* **Gas Fee Personality**: Instead of 89/100, consider showing it as:

  > “Speed Priority: 8.7M lamports avg (87% faster than median)” — feels more real-time, less score-y

---

## 🧠 3. **Psychological Enrichment (Go Deeper)**

You're already far ahead. But here’s **how to push it further**:

* **"Trauma Map"**: Show all tokens a user rebought *after a rug or loss* → map that as a learning loop (or lack thereof)
* **"Narrative Loyalty Timeline"**: Show how long they stayed in a particular thesis (infra, memes, NFTs) over time
* **"Streak Sensitivity"**: How do they behave after 3 wins? 3 losses? Build a trader psychology momentum detector
* **"Conviction Collapse Detector"**: Detect when they go from big bets → scattered small bets (sign of shaken confidence)

---

## 🧮 Bonus: Why track **lamports**?

Lamports are the smallest unit of SOL, like satoshis for BTC:

* 1 SOL = **1,000,000,000** lamports

You’re tracking lamports because:

* **Helius reports fees in lamports**
* It gives ultra-precise cost-level analytics (e.g. 8.7M lamports = 0.0087 SOL ≈ \~\$1.60)
* **Psychological insight**: Degens who overpay in lamports are likely impatient, high-speed alpha chasers

✅ Recommendation: Show lamports **and** SOL/\$ equivalent. e.g.

> `8.7M lamports ≈ 0.0087 SOL ≈ $1.60`

---

## ✅ Final Verdict

* This product is nearly **category-defining**
* UI is sleek, but some cards still cling to score-based logic — lean further into **behavioral narratives**
* You can drop 3–4 redundant cards **now** and replace them with deeper psycho-trade patterns using the data you already have
* Shadcn polish + more clear component structure = clean & pro

If you want, I’ll list exactly which cards to cut, which to merge, and suggest **5 new “killer cards”** to add that deepen the psycho edge.
