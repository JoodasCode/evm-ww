Yeah bro, you're 100% right — **this is still broken** in a very obvious way:

---

### 💥 WHAT’S GOING WRONG (AGAIN)

Your `/api/cards/:wallet` route is **still triggering the full pipeline** because:

1. **Redis check is working ✅**
2. **Postgres fallback is NOT working ❌**

   * The query fails every time → `"Database query failed"`
   * That forces `analyzeWallet()` to re-run every time 💀
   * So even if the data exists in `psy_cards`, it’s not found

---

### 🔍 WHAT TO DO NEXT (FIX IT)

You need to **debug the actual database call** inside `queryStoredAnalysis()` (or wherever you're doing this). Here's **exactly** what to check:

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Debug Plan

#### 1. Confirm Table Exists

Run this inside Postgres shell or connect with a client (e.g. TablePlus or Supabase):

```sql
SELECT * FROM psy_cards LIMIT 1;
```

If this fails, then the `psy_cards` table is missing or has the wrong schema.

---

#### 2. Confirm Column Exists

Make sure `wallet_address` is a real column:

```sql
SELECT wallet_address FROM psy_cards LIMIT 1;
```

If this fails, update your query or schema.

---

#### 3. Confirm Matching Wallet Exists

Double check that this wallet is actually saved:

```sql
SELECT * FROM psy_cards WHERE wallet_address = 'CyaE1VxvBrahnPWkqm5VsdCvyS2QmNht2UFrKJHga54o';
```

If it returns 0 rows, then the analysis is either not being saved correctly OR the column is slightly misnamed (e.g. `wallet`, `address`, etc.)

---

#### 4. Fix the Code Query (IMPORTANT)

In your `server/routes.ts` or `postgresWalletPipeline.ts`, the code should look like:

```ts
const result = await pool.query(
  'SELECT * FROM psy_cards WHERE wallet_address = $1',
  [walletAddress]
);
```

💡 **If this throws**, wrap it in a try/catch and log the error stack:

```ts
try {
  const result = await pool.query(
    'SELECT * FROM psy_cards WHERE wallet_address = $1',
    [walletAddress]
  );
  if (result.rows.length > 0) {
    console.log('[POSTGRES HIT]');
    return result.rows[0];
  } else {
    console.log('[POSTGRES MISS]');
  }
} catch (err) {
  console.error('DB error:', err.stack || err.message);
}
```

This will tell you **what exactly is broken**.

---

### 🧠 TL;DR

Your Redis is working. Your Helius/Moralis analysis is working.
**Only the Postgres fallback is failing.**

🩹 **Fix the SELECT query**
✅ Confirm table/columns
✅ Confirm the wallet exists
✅ Wrap the code in logging to see the actual SQL error

Then you’ll kill the re-analysis loop **once and for all**.

Want me to write the fallback logic as a reusable function for you?
